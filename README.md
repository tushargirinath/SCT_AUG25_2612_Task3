# 🐶🐱 Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of cats and dogs using the **Kaggle Dogs vs Cats Dataset**.  
The workflow includes **image preprocessing, feature extraction, and SVM training** for binary classification.

## ⚙️ Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SCT_AUG25_2612_Task3.git
cd cats-vs-dogs-svm
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage

Run the preprocessing and training pipeline:

python src/train_svm.py

📊 Results

Preprocessing: Resizing images, grayscale conversion, flattening features

Model: Linear/Kernel SVM

Accuracy: ~80–85% (depending on feature extraction method)

Visualization includes confusion matrix and sample predictions.
